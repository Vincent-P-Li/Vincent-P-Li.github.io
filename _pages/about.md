I am a third-year psychology undergraduate from [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interest is very broad, but majorly includes how people acquire and comprehend language in different social contexts and during communication (verbally or virtually). I am also interested and experienced in scientific communications, especially by writing blogs and articles for general public. 

I am currently working as a research assistant for [Prof Martin Pickering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/martin-pickering) and [Dr Naomi Nota](https://www.naominota.nl/) on cognitive load and language prediction, majorly responsible for data collection and materials preparation. I am fully trained to use eye tracking (EyeLink 1000 and experiment builder) to conduct the experiment fully by myself. I am also good at statistics (including univariate, multivariate, and multi-level models, etc.) using RStudio, and also learning Python and EEG online. 

I am also working for Dr Aja Murray on a mental health and digital usage project. I am also preparing a pragmatics project with [Prof Martin Corley](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/martin-corley) and [Joshua Hew](https://j2hwz.github.io/index.html). I have also collaborated to finish a narrative synthesis for Overcome on the effects of digital CBT on relieving premenstrual syndrome. I also funded by the Edinburgh Scientific Research Association on a project that studies the difference on creativity performance with eal-life vs. virtual coffee shop noise, and presented it on its annual conference.

Except for the research area, I am also the British Student Ambassador of the University of Edinburgh and have been working as a psychology programme representative for two years. I am also involved into cirriculum transformation as a student advisor.

When I am not doing research, I enjoy staying at home and doing some reading. I also like (and have been highly rated in) photography and English Caligraghy. I sometimes write novels and travel.
